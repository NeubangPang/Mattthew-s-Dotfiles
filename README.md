# How to install them
Copy the dotfiles and place them in to your **$HOME** folder. If u want to be sure, u can install all of the packages that i'm using (Run the **install_packages.sh** script).
Also u need to manually replace the paths in:
```
~/.config/waybar/style.css
```
```
~/.config/wlogout/style.css
```
```
~/.config/rofi/config.rasi
```
Just open them and replace the path with your **username** rather than mine.

Also i might recommend u to check our the **~/.config/hypr/categories/** folder and customize everything for ur needs, like monitor setup, keybindings, autostart applications and etc. 
After u done all of that, u need to reload the pywal using the command 
```
wal -i "PathToYourWallpaper"
```
